    "# GameDay2021 Live GUI Draft Example\n",
    "\n",
    "See the GameDay_Notebook for examples of running simulations.  This page will focus in-depth on using the code in a live-draft situation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You need three components, all which are provided, but can be edited/substituted:\n",
    "1. Projections\n",
    "2. Rankings\n",
    "3. Injuries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projections \n",
    "Made available for you via [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/projections.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&type=zips) are ZiPS, Steamer, and TheBat projections.  Adding your own shouldn't be too hard, see the directories and data for formatting.  \n",
    "#### Rankings \n",
    "Available rankings were scraped from FantasyPros, which give you the option to choose from Yahoo, ESPN, etc., so that adding your own is simple and could provide an edge.  Case in point, I'm working on my own ranking based off simulations and will soon add the option.  \n",
    "#### Injuries\n",
    "Filtering out players no longer available will improve the prediction power of the code.  Simply add names to the injury spreadsheet provided.  \n",
    "#### Live-Draft Picks\n",
    "New GUI replaces previous editing of Excel spreadsheet but still requires user input.  Since drafting is live, you will need to enter the draft results of every team as it's happening.  \n"
