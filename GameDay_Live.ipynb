    "# GameDay2021 Live Draft Example\n",
    "\n",
    "See the GameDay_Notebook for examples of running simulations.  This page will focus in-depth on using the code in a live-draft situation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You need four components, all which are provided, but can be edited/substituted:\n",
    "1. Projections\n",
    "2. Rankings\n",
    "3. Injuries\n",
    "4. Excel spreadsheet of picks in real-time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projections \n",
    "Made available for you via [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/projections.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&type=zips) are ZiPS, Steamer, and TheBat projections.  Adding your own shouldn't be too hard, see the directories and data for formatting.  \n",
    "#### Rankings \n",
    "Available rankings were scraped from Yahoo and FantasyPros, but adding your own is simple and could provide an edge; case in point, I'm working on improved, simulation-based rankings right now!\n",
    "#### Injuries\n",
    "Filtering out players no longer available will improve the prediction power of the code.  Simply add names to the injury spreadsheet provided.  \n",
    "#### Live-Draft Picks\n",
    "This is the pain point.  I've made an effort to minimize the work needed by the user, but each draft is live, and you need to know what the composition of every team is as it's happening.  \n"
